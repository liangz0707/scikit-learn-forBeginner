    "High-dimensional datasets can be very difficult to visualize.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to accomplish this dimensionality reduction is by taking a random projection: In a random projection, it is likely that the more interesting structure within the data will be lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this concern, a number of supervised and unsupervised linear dimensionality reduction frameworks have been designed, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA):These methods can be powerful, but often miss important non-linear structure in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manifold Learning can be thought of as an attempt to generalize linear frameworks like PCA to be sensitive to non-linear structure in data. Though supervised variants exist, the typical manifold learning problem is unsupervised: it learns the high-dimensional structure of the data from the data itself, without the use of predetermined classifications."
